Thesis
  Comparison of how the three major http servers take advantage of the
  operating system, how their approaches differ and what argument stands behind
  each approach.

  1 httpd
      http://httpd.apache.org/
  2 lighttpd
      http://www.lighttpd.net/
  3 nginx
      http://nginx.org/

Optimization (general, keep in mind):
- How do they ensure responsiveness from OS?
- How do (if) they utilize the TCP/IP stack differently?
- Is there a general theme to how each is utilizing its resources (the OS)?

To Dig:
* download source for each
  - get highlevel overview of function walk through.
* find indications of each server's internal defaults, as basis for code
  walk-through:
  - read up on "optimizing"-[server]
  - read up on benchmark comparisons
* smerril suggestions:
  - apache vs nginx
    - threaded vs event-based
    - read: c10k challenge

* threaded response "thread pool" -- see ./notes/0923 section: "combined-level
  threads"
    --  is this taking advantage of an "asynchronous" signal, as opposed to
    "synchronous" signal?
