Using the account that your instructor assigned to you create a structure that
will have 4 Regions (North, South, East, West) and 4 Departments in each Region
(Sales, Accounting, Inventory and Manufacturing) and 4 people in each
department (Names up to you). Using vi create a text file that you can
propagate though all of the people directories. Print out the structure and
file status.
