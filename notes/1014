memory:
  primary
  - "real"
  - main
  - physical
  - "core"
    [ artifact magnetic from old cylinder-based storage ]
  secondary
  - magnetic disk
  - optical disk
  - magnetic tape disk

hierarchies:
  cache > primary > secondary
  (speed -> whaoo ->   OMGGG)

management stratgies:
  ( relative to processor )
  - fetch
    when to move data main <-> secondary
  - placement
    how to move data into main
  - replacement
    when to move out of main, replace w/new, why

contiguous vs noncontiguous
---- memory allocation ----
  - contiguous
    - single user, like CP/M
    - may have replacement strategy, eg: overlays
    - may/may not have memory protection
  - noncontiguous
    - single/multi user
    - many types, eg.: partitions, paging, etc.
    - eg, partitions may be fixed or variable

    offset/limit

multi user/multi programming
---- environments ----------
  - fixed partitions
    - split memory, pick one to run N progs
    - may have mem.protection
  - variable partitions
    - dynamically determina partition sizes
    - can lead to fragmentation
    - OS uses memory compaction or garbage collection
    - may have mem.protection

memory placement stratgies
  - first-fit
    stick prog in first hole
  - best-fit
    go through mem./ find smallest possible
  - worst-fit
    find big hole, fill partically, leave rest of hole
